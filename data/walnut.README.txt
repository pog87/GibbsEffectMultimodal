The walnut.nii.gz dataset has been taken from www.voreen.org and has been converted to NIfTI format by Alexander Wiebel. The walnut_masked.nii.gz dataset has been created from the segmentation information on www.voreen.org using OpenWalnut.

Contents of README.txt for segmentation of walnut dataset

This archive contains probabilistic segmentations as well as binary masks of
four segments of the Voreen walnut dataset (http://www.voreen.org/files/walnut.zip):
 * complete nut
 * outer nutshell
 * core (enclosing the seed)
 * seed
 
Additionally, the "walnut-segmentation" volume stores the complete segmentation by
assigning the intensity values 1 till 4 to the four segments.

The walnut data set is courtesy of European Institut of Molecular Imaging (EIMI),
Muenster, Germany (http://www.uni-muenster.de/EIMI/).

The segmentations have been obtained with our guided Random Walker approach:
  J.-S. Prassni, T. Ropinski, and K. Hinrichs: Uncertainty-Aware Guided Volume Segmentation.
  IEEE TVCG, 16(6): 1358-1365, 2010.

You may use the segmentations freely, but please include the above reference, 
if you use them in scientific work.
